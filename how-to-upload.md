To upload and host your PHP and React project on an **EC2 instance** using the AWS Free Tier, you will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create an EC2 Instance

1. **Login to AWS Management Console:**
   - Visit the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - Log in with your credentials.

2. **Launch a New EC2 Instance:**
   - In the AWS Console, type **EC2** in the search bar and click on EC2 to open the EC2 dashboard.
   - Click on **Launch Instance**.
   
3. **Configure Your Instance:**
   - **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):**
     - Select an **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** AMI (or **Amazon Linux 2** if you prefer). This provides a Linux environment compatible with PHP and React.
   - **Instance Type:**
     - Select the **t2.micro** instance type (free-tier eligible).
   - **Key Pair:**
     - Create or choose an existing SSH key pair. This is used to securely access your instance.
   - **Configure Network:**
     - Allow necessary ports:
       - **Port 22 (SSH)**: For remote access.
       - **Port 80 (HTTP)**: For web traffic.
       - **Port 443 (HTTPS)**: For secure traffic (optional if using SSL).
   - **Storage Configuration:**
     - Use the default storage, which is eligible under the Free Tier.

4. **Launch the Instance:**
   - Review your settings and click **Launch**.

### Step 2: Connect to the EC2 Instance

1. **Connect via SSH:**
   - Once your instance is running, go to **Instances** on the EC2 dashboard.
   - Select your instance and click on **Connect**. Follow the instructions provided to SSH into the server.

   Example SSH command:
   ```bash
   ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@your-instance-public-ip
   ```

2. **Update and Install Required Packages:**
   After logging in, update the package manager and install the necessary software (Apache, PHP, Node.js):
   
   **Update the server:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

   **Install Apache (Web Server):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install apache2 -y
   ```

   **Install PHP:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y
   ```

   **Install Node.js and npm (for React):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
   ```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Project

#### PHP Project Setup
1. **Upload Your PHP Project Files:**
   - Use **SCP** (secure copy) to upload files to your server. From your local machine, run the following command to upload your PHP files:
     ```bash
     scp -i "your-key.pem" -r /path-to-your-local-project-files/ ubuntu@your-instance-public-ip:/var/www/html/
     ```

   - Your PHP files will now be copied to the web directory `/var/www/html/`.

2. **Set Permissions:**
   Ensure proper permissions for your web files:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/
   ```

3. **Restart Apache:**
   After setting up your PHP files, restart Apache to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

4. **Test Your PHP App:**
   Open a browser and go to `http://your-instance-public-ip` to check if your PHP application is running.

#### React Project Setup
1. **Upload Your React Project Files:**
   Similar to the PHP upload, use `scp` to upload your React project:
   ```bash
   scp -i "your-key.pem" -r /path-to-your-react-project/ ubuntu@your-instance-public-ip:/home/ubuntu/
   ```

2. **Build Your React App:**
   SSH into your EC2 instance and navigate to the React project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/your-react-project/
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Move Build Files to Web Directory:**
   Once your React project is built, move the files to `/var/www/html/`:
   ```bash
   sudo mv build/* /var/www/html/
   ```

4. **Test Your React App:**
   Open `http://your-instance-public-ip` to see your React app in action.

### Step 4: Configure Apache for PHP and React

1. **Create a Virtual Host (Optional but recommended for larger setups):**
   Set up a virtual host for your PHP and React project if needed:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
   ```

   Add the following configuration:
   ```bash
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       DocumentRoot /var/www/html
       <Directory /var/www/html>
           AllowOverride All
           Require all granted
       </Directory>
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

   Save and exit (`Ctrl + O`, then `Ctrl + X`).

2. **Enable Rewrite Module (Optional for routing in React):**
   If you have routing in your React app, enable the Apache rewrite module:
   ```bash
   sudo a2enmod rewrite
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

### Step 5: (Optional) Configure SSL (HTTPS)
To enable HTTPS, you can install a free SSL certificate using **Let’s Encrypt**:

1. Install Certbot:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
   ```

2. Obtain and Install SSL Certificate:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot --apache
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to configure HTTPS for your domain (you must have a registered domain name for this step).

### Step 6: Monitor and Manage Your Instance

1. **Monitoring:**
   Use **CloudWatch** to monitor the performance and resource usage of your EC2 instance (free within certain limits).
   
2. **Scaling:**
   If your project grows, you may want to upgrade to a larger instance. You can stop your instance, change its type, and restart it as needed.

### Step 7: Clean Up When Done
When you no longer need the EC2 instance, terminate it to avoid charges:
1. Go to the **EC2 dashboard**.
2. Select your instance, click **Actions** → **Instance State** → **Terminate**.

### Conclusion
By following this guide, you can successfully upload and host your PHP and React project on AWS using an EC2 instance in the Free Tier. Make sure to monitor your usage to stay within free-tier limits.
